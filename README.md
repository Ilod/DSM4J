Dsm for java is an open source java library for Synology DSM Api, it's basically a wrapper for the API.
you can find all information about the api [here](https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/Software/DeveloperGuide/Package/FileStation/All/enu/Synology_File_Station_API_Guide.pdf) available for developers who want's to know how the api works.

If you find yourself on this page, it means that you have a java project and you need to communicate with your Nas Synology.
This wrapper can be a great startup for that.
I am trying to build the most complete wrapper for synology.
You are welcome if you want to help me, I will be greatfull.

##Prerequisites

This project is written in java 8. you can only use it in a project that uses java 8 and above.
if you want to use it in any environment, make sure you the right JVM installed on the machine.

##Integration tests

Most of the tests need an actual Synology Nas. 
Make sure you have the Synology in the same network as your server, or set a DDNS to access your synology easily from internet. Look at this official tutorial : [How to make Synology NAS accessible over the Internet](https://www.synology.com/en-global/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Network/How_to_make_Synology_NAS_accessible_over_the_Internet)
Don't forget to use the firewall to restrict unknown ip from accessing your portal.

you have to define an environment file  in your resource folder``env.properties`` in which you have to put this lines :

| host=http://example.diskstation.me |                                                             
| --- |                                                                     
| port=5000 | 
| username=user  | 
| password=passwd   | 

## How to use it

add the maven repository to your pom.xml

```java
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.github.ccenyo</groupId>
            <artifactId>DSM4J</artifactId>
            <version>1.2.1</version>
        </dependency>
```

##Basic usage


```java
    DsmAuth auth = DsmAuth.fromResource("env.properties");
    DsmFileStationClient client = DsmFileStationClient.login(auth);
    
    //get the list of all folders in a ROOT_FOLDER = /homes
    Response<DsmListFolderResponse> response = client.ls(ROOT_HOME).call();

    //Files
    response.getData().getFiles();
```

you can create an ``auth`` object in different ways

```java
    DsmAuth auth = DsmAuth.fromResource("env.properties");
```
or
```java
    DsmAuth dsmAuth = DsmAuth.fromFile(file);
```
or
```java
    DsmAuth dsmAuth = DsmAuth.of(host, port, username, password);
```

## Non blocking usage

Some features are non-blocking you have to start the request and then check the status before getting the result

```java
            Response<DsmDeleteResponse> deleteResponse = client.advancedDelete()
                    .addFileToDelete(ROOT_FOLDER+"/"+fileToDownload.getName())
                    .start();

            Response<DsmDeleteResponse> statusResponse = client.advancedDelete()
                    .taskId(deleteResponse.getData().getTaskid())
                    .status();

// you can stop the request if you don't want the result anymore

            client.advancedDelete()
                .taskId(deleteResponse.getData().getTaskid())
                .stop();
```
